            <h2>About Me</h2>
            <p>Hi there! I'm Vansh Gupta, a passionate student currently pursuing my B.Tech in Computer Science and Engineering with a major focus on Artificial Intelligence at Parul University.
                
                Ever since I embarked on my journey into the world of technology, I've been captivated by the endless possibilities that Machine Learning and Artificial Intelligence offer. I thrive on the challenges and excitement of being at the forefront of this rapidly evolving field.
                
                My journey in programming began with languages like Python and Java, which laid the foundation for my exploration into the realm of AI. Currently, I'm delving deeper into ML/AI libraries, particularly focusing on Computer Vision, where I'm constantly amazed by the transformative power of visual data interpretation.
                
                One of the most rewarding aspects of my academic journey has been my involvement in various hackathons. I've had the privilege of participating in several competitions, consistently ranking in the top 5. These experiences have not only honed my technical skills but have also taught me the importance of collaboration, creativity, and problem-solving under pressure.
                
                Beyond my academic and technical pursuits, I'm driven by a desire to make a meaningful impact in the AI community. I'm particularly fascinated by the potential of Language Models (LLMs) and their role in advancing AI research and applications. My deep understanding of LLMs has been instrumental in expanding my knowledge and capabilities in AI-related fields.
                
                In my free time, you'll often find me immersed in coding challenges, exploring new ML algorithms, or contributing to open-source projects. I believe in continuous learning and am always seeking opportunities to broaden my horizons and stay updated with the latest advancements in technology.
                
                I'm excited about the possibilities that lie ahead and am eager to leverage my skills and passion to contribute positively to the ever-evolving landscape of Artificial Intelligence.
                
                Feel free to connect with me to discuss AI, technology, or anything that sparks your curiosity!

                <h3>Portfolio Topic 1</h3>
                <p>Creating Chatbot Using LLM for Government Website:</p>
                    <p>Developed a sophisticated chatbot leveraging Language Models (LLMs) to enhance user interaction and accessibility on a government website. The chatbot utilizes cutting-edge Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques to provide real-time assistance, answer queries, and guide users through various services and information resources. By integrating LLMs, the chatbot offers intelligent responses and adapts to user inputs, improving overall user experience and efficiency in accessing government services.</p>
                <h3>Portfolio Topic 2</h3>
                <p>Creating ML Model on Calculating Delay of Trains on Various Factors:</p>
                <p>Designed and implemented a machine learning model to predict train delays based on various factors such as weather conditions, infrastructure issues, and historical data. The model leverages advanced regression techniques and data analysis to accurately forecast potential delays, enabling railway authorities to proactively manage schedules, optimize resources, and minimize disruptions. By harnessing the power of machine learning, the model empowers decision-makers to make informed operational decisions and improve the reliability of train services.</p>
                <h3>Portfolio Topic 3</h3>
                <p>Creating Air Pollution Prediction Using LSTM:</p>
                <p>Developed an innovative LSTM (Long Short-Term Memory) based model for predicting air pollution levels in urban areas. By analyzing historical air quality data and environmental factors such as weather patterns and traffic congestion, the model generates accurate forecasts of pollution levels for different time intervals. This predictive capability enables city planners, policymakers, and environmental agencies to implement targeted interventions, mitigate pollution-related health risks, and enhance overall air quality management strategies.</p>
